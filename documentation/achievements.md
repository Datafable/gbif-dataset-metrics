# Achievements

## Description

Achievements highlight certain aspects of a dataset that score particularly well, in of itself or compared to other datasets. They are typically based on the dataset metrics we calculate and are provided as *gold* and *silver* achievements. It allows the user and data publisher to discover the strenghts of a dataset and encourages the data publisher to strive for good data quality.

## Types of achievements

### Occurrences achievement

This achievement compares the number of occurrences of a dataset with other GBIF-mediated datasets for which we have calculated metrics.

* **Colossal dataset**: More occurrences than 99% of the datasets on GBIF.
* **Huge dataset**: More occurrences than 95% of the datasets on GBIF.

Note that until we have calculated metrics for all datasets, this achievement will be granted "too soon".

### Georeference achievement

This achievement is based on the [coordinate quality metric](coordinates-bar.md).

* **Georeferencing perfection**: 100% valid coordinates.
* **Georeferencing excellence**: More than 95% valid coordinates.

### Multimedia achievement

This achievement is based on the [multimedia metric](multimedia-bar.md).

* **Multimedia treasure**:  More than 90% related multimedia (with a valid URL).
* **Multimedia gem**: More than 80% related multimedia (with a valid URL).

## Suggestions for improvement

* Achievement based on the completeness of the metadata.
* Achievement based on the license under which the dataset has been published.
* Achievement based on any other metric we implement.
* Breakdown of achievements across certain axes: e.g. biggest herbarium dataset, most taxonomically diverse mammal dataset, etc.
